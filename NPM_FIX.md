# Fix npm Cache Issue & Run Development Server

## The Issue
You have npm cache permission issues that prevent installing dependencies locally.

## Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Fix npm Cache (Recommended)
Run this command in Terminal to fix the permission issue:

```bash
sudo chown -R 501:20 "/Users/michaelhemker/.npm"
```

Then install dependencies and start the server:
```bash
cd /Users/michaelhemker/inkd-landing
npm install
npm start
```

### Option 2: Use Preview File (Immediate)
I've created a `preview.html` file that shows the landing page design:

```bash
open /Users/michaelhemker/inkd-landing/preview.html
```

This will open the landing page in your default browser.

### Option 3: Deploy to Vercel (Best for Production)
Since the code is already committed to git, you can:

1. **Create GitHub Repository**:
   ```bash
   # Go to github.com and create a new repository called "inkd-landing"
   # Then push your code:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/inkd-landing.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project" 
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Click "Deploy" (Vercel will handle npm install automatically)

### Option 4: Use Different Package Manager
If you have Homebrew, install yarn:
```bash
brew install yarn
cd /Users/michaelhemker/inkd-landing
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix npm cache** using Option 1 above
2. **Run `npm start`** to see the full React version
3. **Deploy to Vercel** for production hosting
4. **Connect your custom domain** in Vercel settings

The `preview.html` file gives you a quick look at the design, but the full React version has all the animations and interactive features!
